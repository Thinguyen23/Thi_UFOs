# UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy?

Presents a cohesive written summary that describes the purpose of the project, the technologies used, and 1 recommendation for further development.
In this project, we help Dana build a dynamic webpage which takes in inputs from users and displays the filtered data based on the input filters. The webpage is on UFO sightings in January 2010. Users interact with the page by inputting filters to refine results.

We start by building a table to hold and dispay the data stored in a JavaScript array. With JavaScript, we were able to display and manipulate the date we want to work with. We add filters to the table which let users refine their search. The table is inserted into and visually displayed by an html page. We use HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to build and style the entire page. We also create a header, article summary for the page.

As seen from the webpage, the table is filtered by date, city, state, country and shape. The ability to pinpoint a search by these filters would go a long way in providing more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

### Recommendation for further development
The website could be improved by adding filters by maximum or minimum values such as the city or state with the most UFO sightings. A total row at the end of the table would also help in tracking number of results for each search. These additions would give a more robust picture of UFO sightings.
